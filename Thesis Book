**DESCRIPTION
"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes," said Andy Warhol. 
15mins Corner Story is an interactive window display inspired by Warhol's quote. 
We use two basic elements - a button and a screen - to engage people to take pictures in five different public locations, with the goal of encouraging people from diverse background to actively engage with their surrounding environments. 15 mins Corner Story shows the egalitarian nature of public art and self-portraits in different public spaces. Through these five local design projects, I am interested in exploring factors that will encourage people to express themselves and communicate with the local discourse communities.
// What imspire my? I want to make a installation for people easier to access, so I can make a documentary from that.
