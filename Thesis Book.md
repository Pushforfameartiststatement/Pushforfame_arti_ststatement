Push For Fame
##SYNOPSIS
Push For Fame is a collective narrative pieces that collect stories we don't know about this corner. 
It uses interactive media as a way to approach people that is hard to approach.
##DESCRIPTION
"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes," said Andy Warhol. 
Push For Fame is an interactive window display inspired by Warhol's quote. 
We use three basic elements - a button, a screen, and a camera - 
to engage people to take pictures in four different public locations, 
with the goal of encouraging people from diverse background to actively engage with their surrounding environments.
Push For Fame shows the egalitarian nature of public art and self-portraits in different public spaces.
Through these four local design projects,
I am interested in exploring factors that will encourage people to express themselves and communicate with the local discourse communities without language.

// What imspire my? I want to make a installation for people easier to access, so I can make a documentary from that.
